# Welcome to The Scraper Take Home Assignement
It's a sample project which is a scraper written in Python.

# How it works?
The Scraper project allows you to collect data from a specific URL. The whole process contains two main steps, the **crawling** step and the **downloading** step.
In the first step, the crawler creats a **sietmap** of the specified site and the second step is downloading all the necessary files and pages based on the collected sitemap.

## How to Run

To run the project just do the folow:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/aryan-arabshahi/scraper.git
scraper --base-url https://www.classcentral.com --translate hi --export-path /Users/Aryan/sample/scraper
```

**NOTE:** It's a take-home assignment and it has not been finished.
